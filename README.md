Very light task bar extension for GNOME Shell.

In this repository you will find the GS 3.36+ version only. You can download the obsolete but fully working 3.28 -> 3.34 version through the above link to GS extension website. You can also add some ".actor" here and here in this current code but I don't have the time to maintain two versions.

THIS EXTENSION IS NO MORE UNDER DEVELOPMENT, please use https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4000/babar/
