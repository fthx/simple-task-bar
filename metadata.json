No settings but you can easily play around with CSS file. This extension is light and should not interfere with GNOME Shell behaviour+logic. If you want more, please consider installing Dash to Panel. Give a try to Horizontal Workspaces + Workspace Indicator (official extensions) to get a classical setup.",
